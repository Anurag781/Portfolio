## 1. About

This portfolio is a clean, modern, and fully responsive React web application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey.

Built with React.js, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, this site presents my work in a dynamic, data-driven way. It features a beautiful UI, smooth navigation, and sections for “About Me,” “Projects,” “Skills,” and “Contact.”

The purpose of this portfolio is threefold:

Grow – to act as a live, evolving project that I continuously update as I learn new technologies and complete more work.
